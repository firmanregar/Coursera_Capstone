Introductions
For the final Capstone Project in the IBM Certificate Course, Coursera has provided a set of traffic accident related data to base this final project on. 
The data was collected by the Seattle Police Department, recorded by Traffic Records, and provided by Coursera via a download link. 
The time period for this data is from 2004- present and contains such information as severity in terms of human fatality, traffic delay, property damage, or any other type of accident bad impact. 

With the given set of data, the task was to identify a problem and who would be interested in a solution to this problem. 
Based on my preliminary review of the data, I decided to explore the amount of accidents that occur in areas labeled as “Junctiontype”. 
I chose this for a couple of reasons. One being, I was interested in what the data would show. Two, if the data shows this to be a problem in certain areas, then putting a weather, road condition and light condition up in those areas would be a relatively easy fix.

Methodology
For the data analysis portion of this project, Github was used for a repository and I chose to use IBM Watson Studio to host the notebook. 
To host the large collision csv file, it was uploaded to IBM Cloud.
The Python libraries utilized throughout the analysis were Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Once the data from the csv file was read, I used df.types in order to see what type of data was contained within the spreadsheet. 
Because I was trying to determine the amount of accidents occurring with the condition of “Junctiontype”, I chose to focus on the Severity Code, Weather, Road condition and Light condition.
